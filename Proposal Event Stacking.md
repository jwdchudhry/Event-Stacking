					PROJECT PROPOSAL
				Block-Chain Based Event Stacking

Group Members:
1)JAWAD ALI
2) MIAN ABDUL MANNAN

Project Idea:
This project will lead us to write a smart contract that lets people pay a small amount to a pool, RSVP for an event, and only the people who attend share in the pool reward. If someone has requested to attend your event but does not come, they lose their staked cryptocurrency.

Technology Overview:
This project introduces us to the concept of staking, a well-known concept in web3 and decentralized finance. Staking is a way of earning rewards for holding certain cryptocurrencies, so this project gives you a small glimpse into that process.

Skills to learn:
1) Creating a pool of cryptocurrencies (ETH, for example) and distributing them among approved users.
2)Keeping track of attendees and time throughout the event.
